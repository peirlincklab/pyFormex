"""Shapes

This example illustrates how pyFormex can be used in education.
I started this example when my daughter learned programming at school.
She had to create this image using Java(Beans).
It took days of wrestling with complex programming environments, compiling
multiple files, endless checking and debugging java declaraions and code.
I showed her how I could get to the same result with just a few lines of
pyFormex code.

Later I added some nice utilities to make it worthwile as a programming example.
It would be nice a nice exercise to add a GUI to create and position the shapes.

"""Timer: Measuring elapsed time.

.. note:: Contrary to its use in plain English, we use the word 'timer'
   here for a device that measures the time between two events, not one
   that counts down a given amount of time.

The Timer class provides a convenient way to measure the time between two
events. When developing algorithms for operations on large data models,
accurate and multiple measurements of the time spent in different parts
of the code are a vital accessory. The Timer class aims at making the
process of measuring and reporting as simple is possible for a variety
of uses. The following examples illustrate the most common use cases.

Examples
--------
We use :func:`time.sleep` to provide a dummy code block with some known
execution time.

>>> from time import sleep

The example below shows the three basic steps: create a timer, make
a measurement, report the result. A Timer instance acts as a context
manager, so it can be used in a with statement. The time spent in the
block inside the with clause is then measured.

>>> t = Timer()      # 1. create a Timer
>>> with t:          # 2. measure the time for a code block
...     sleep(0.07)
>>> print(t)         # 3. report the measured time
Timer: 0.07... sec. Acc: 0.07... sec.

Notice that two values are printed out: the first is the measured time,
the second is the accumulated time of all measurements with this timer.
Let's add a second measurement:

>>> sleep(0.05)
>>> with t:
...     sleep(0.06)
>>> print(t)
Timer: 0.06... sec. Acc: 0.13... sec.

Notice that only the time inside the with block is measured.
Printing out the Timer after measurement is so common, that there is
an option to do it automatically. Just set the auto mode on
(this can also be given as an option when creating the Timer).

>>> t.auto = True
>>> with t:
...     sleep(0.03)
Timer: 0.03... sec. Acc: 0.16... sec.

If you do not need the accumulation feature, you can switch it off by
setting acc=None. We create a new Timer t1, with appropriate tag. The
tag is the string printed before the timer values (the default tag is
'Timer'):

>>> with Timer('No accumulation', auto=True, acc=None) as t1:
...     sleep(0.07)
No accumulation: 0.07... sec.
>>> with t1: sleep(0.13)
No accumulation: 0.13... sec.

You can specify the precision of the output (the actual readings
are still done at the highest precision):

>>> t2 = Timer('Precision 2', dec=2, auto=True)
>>> with t2: sleep(0.057)
Precision 2: 0.06 sec. Acc: 0.06 sec.
>>> with t2: sleep(0.093)
Precision 2: 0.09 sec. Acc: 0.15 sec.

When using multiple timers it is often convenient to be able to use a single
variable to keep all Timer instances alive, or to print all the timers at once.
The :class:`Timers` class provides a list of Timer instances to allow that.

>>> timers = Timers(t, t1, t2)
>>> print(timers)
Timer report
  Timer: 0.03... sec. Acc: 0.16... sec.
  No accumulation: 0.13... sec.
  Precision 2: 0.09 sec. Acc: 0.15 sec.
>>> print(len(timers))
3

Plain list methods can be used on the Timers class, but you shouldn't add
anything but Timer instances. The :meth:`get` method retrieves a Timer by its
tag. If multiple timers have the same tag, you can only get the first one.

>>> print(timers.get('No accumulation'))
No accumulation: 0.13... sec.
>>> t3 = Timer('Precision 2')
>>> timers.append(t3)
>>> print(len(timers))
4
>>> timers.get('Precision 2') is t3
False
>>> timers.get('Precision 2') is t2
True
>>> timers.clear()
>>> print(len(timers))
0

Timer context managers can be nested, so one can easily do partial
and overall timings at the same time:

>>> with Timer("Outer block", dec=2, reg=timers):
...    sleep(0.08)
...    with Timer("Inner block", dec=2, reg=timers):
...        sleep(0.12)
...    sleep(0.07)
...    with Timer("Inner block 2", dec=2, reg=timers):
...        sleep(0.17)
...    sleep(0.06)
...
>>> print(timers)
Timer report
  Outer block: 0.50 sec. Acc: 0.50 sec.
  Inner block: 0.12 sec. Acc: 0.12 sec.
  Inner block 2: 0.17 sec. Acc: 0.17 sec.

The output of the above on some machine gave::

    Process time: 0.02... sec. Acc: 0.02... sec.
    Real time: 0.08... sec. Acc: 0.08... sec.

There may be times when the use of a context manager is not useful
or even possible (like when the start and end of measurement are in
different functions). Then you can always use the low level interface.
The measurement is always done with the :meth:`read` method. It measures
and returns the time since the last :meth:`start` or the creation of the
Timer. Here is an example:

>>> t = Timer(dec=2)
>>> sleep(0.03)
>>> v = t.read()
>>> sleep(0.05)
>>> t.start()
>>> sleep(0.07)
>>> v1 = t.read()
>>> print(v, v1)
0.03... 0.07...

The last reading and the accumulated value remain accessible for
further processing or customized reports:

>>> print(t2.mem, t2.acc)
0.09... 0.15...
>>> print(f"'{t2.tag}' timer: last read {t2.mem}"
...       f", accumulated {t2.acc}")
'Precision 2' timer: last read 0.09, accumulated 0.15

You can have a peek at the current value of the timer, without
actually reading it, and thus not chainging the timer's memory:

>>> print(t)
Timer: 0.07 sec. Acc: 0.10 sec.
>>> sleep(0.09)
>>> print(t.value)
0.09...
>>> print(t)
Timer: 0.07 sec. Acc: 0.10 sec.

Measuring process time is easy as well. Just provide another time measuring
function:

>>> timers = Timers(
...     Timer('Real time', auto=True, dec=2, acc=None),
...     Timer('Process time', auto=True, acc=None, timefunc=time.process_time)
... )
>>> with timers:
...     _ = [i*i for i in range(10_000)]  # do something
...     sleep(0.06)
Process time: 0.00... sec.
Real time: 0.06 sec.
"""
import time


class Timer:
    """A class for measuring elapsed time.

    The Timer class is a conventient way to measure and report the elapsed
    time during some processing. It uses Python's :func:`time.perf_counter`,
    providing the highest resolution available. It is however not intended
    for doing micro measurements: use Python's :mod:`timeit` module for
    that.

    A Timer instance can be used as a context manager, with automatic
    reading and even reporting the time spent in the context block.
    The Timer value is a floating point value giving a number of seconds
    elapsed since some undefined reference point. By default this is the
    moment of creation of the Timer, but the starting point can be set at
    any time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tag: str, optional
        A label identifying the Timer. It is shown together with the
        time value when printing the Timer. It is also used as the key
        when registering a Timer.
    timefunc: callable, optional
        A callable returning a float. The difference in value between two calls
        is the measured time in seconds. The default :func:`time.perf_counter`
        measures real time with high precision. Some other useful values:
        :func:`time.time`, :func:`time.monotonic`, :func:`time.process_time`,
        :func:`time.thread_time`.
    dec: int, optional
        The number of decimals that will be shown when printing the Timer.
        The default (6) provides microsecond accuracy, which is more than
        enough for all purposes.
    acc: float | None, optional
        Starting value for the accumulator. When a Timer is read,
        it accumulates the value in its :attr:`acc` attribute. The
        accumulted value is printed out together with the reading.
        A special value None may be provided to switch off the accumulator.
    auto: bool, optional
        If True, switches on auto print mode for the Timer. In auto print mode,
        the value of the Timer is printed out on each :meth:`read` and, when
        using a context manager, on exiting it.
        This is very convenient to quickly do timing of some code block.
        See the examples above.
        If False, the user is responsible for printing out the Timer.
    reg: :class:`Timers`, optional
        If a :class:`Timers` instance is provided, the new :class:`Timer`
        is added to that collection and its value can be printed out together
        with that of the others in the collection.

"""Add tracking facilities to any class.

This module provides some functions to help in creating classes with
tracking facilities. This can e.g. be use to detect if the contents of
a list or dict has been changed.

The tracking facility consists in marking some of the class' methods and
count how many times any of these methods is used.

Examples
--------
>>> TrackedDict = track_class_factory(dict)
>>> D = TrackedDict({'a':1,'b':2})
>>> print(D.hits)
0
>>> D['c'] = 3
>>> print(D.hits)
1
>>> D.hits = 0
>>> print(D.hits)
0
>>> D.update({'d':1,'b':3})
>>> del D['a']
>>> print(D.hits)
2
